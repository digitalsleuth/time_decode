# Date Decode
A timestamp and date decoder. 
Compatible with Python 2.x and 3.x.

I noticed a lack of timestamp conversion utilities in a number of different linux systems. Since I happen to use linux in my day-to-day work I thought this would help.

This was developed with the Digital Forensics field in mind, so all of the testing has been done with the up-to-date SIFT Kit from SANS.
If you have any questions, suggestions, helpful thoughts of any kind, please feel free to drop me a line.

This python script provides the following conversions from existing timestamps:

- Unix Seconds
- Unix Milliseconds
- Windows 64 bit Hex (in Big Endian)
- Windows 64 bit Hex (in Little Endian)
- Google Chrome Time
- Active Directory time
- Unix Hex 32 bit (in Big Endian)
- Unix Hex 32 bit (in Little Endian)
- Cookie Time (Low Value,High Value)
- Windows OLE 64 bit double (in Big Endian)
- Windows OLE 64 bit double (in Little Endian)
- Mac Absolute Time
- HFS/HFS+ Time (in Big Endian)
- HFS/HFS+ Time (in Little Endian)
- MS-DOS 32 bit Hex
- MS-DOS FAT Date + Time
- Microsoft 128 bit SYSTEMTIME
- Microsoft FILETIME/LDAP
- Mozilla PRTime
- OLE Automation Date/Time
- iOS 11 (beta) Date/Time
- Symantec AV timestamp

Note that HFS times are in Local Time, where HFS+ times are in UTC. MS-DOS 32 bit Hex values are also in Local time. All other times, unless expressly mentioned, are in UTC.

I have added a feature to 'guess' in what format the timestamp is that you've provided. This will run the timestamp you provide against all methods, and provide an output if human-readable.
There is also the ability to convert a date-time to all of the aforementioned timestamps. Simply use the following command:

python date_decode.py --timestamp "2017-06-02 13:14:15.678"

The date/time you enter should be in the 'Y-m-d HH:MM:SS.sss' format with the double-quote included, but does not require milli/micro/nano seconds to work. (Double-quote required for Windows Python)
If anyone has any other timestamps they think should be added to this tool, please let me know.
